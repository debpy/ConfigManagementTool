~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*1)A directory /root/Slack needs to be created which will contain all the scripts. In order to change this all the instances of /root/Slack needs to be modified with the given directory  
2)The tool needs to be executed with root user
3)The first time prerequisite packages installation of "inotify-tools", "php", "libapache2-mod-php" must be done using this tool rather than manually.

*Note: Point 1 - > In future dynamic functionality will be implemented which get the directory as command line args and assign it to a variable and which will be used globally.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tool consists of 4 scripts configure.sh, bootstrap.sh, version_Check.sh, config_Check.sh which gets executed in the mentioned order.Each of the script functionalities will be highlighted below

configure.sh
---------------

3)It copies all the 4 above mentioned shell scripts for execution to the target host considering whether it has been copied earlier or there are modifications in the targt host.
4)It takes a note of the hosts already configured by writing their IP to a file
5)It invokes the "bootstrap.sh" internally

bootstrap.sh
-------------

2)It sets up the Apache config and .htaccess with the necessary contents for rendering the web content
3)It writes the Apache & PHP version to the respective files. 
4)It then calls the "version_Check.sh" & "config_Check.sh" internally

version_Check.sh
